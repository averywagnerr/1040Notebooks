    "This article discusses how new JWST data from the SMACS 0723 galaxy cluster is being used to measure and analyze the morphology of its galaxies, and what this means for our current model of the Universe. What JWST found contradicts the previous results from Hubble; while Hubble predicted that the amount of disk shaped galaxies would only make up about 10% of all galaxies at redshifts between 3 and 6, JWST discovered that actually, over 50% of galaxies at these redshift values are disks. This data suggests that disk-shaped galaxies have been living in a stable state for much longer than previously thought –– over 10 billion years. These new findings challenge the previous model of the Universe, and are forcing scientists to rethink how galaxies are formed, and how galaxy mergers actually work. Understanding galaxy formation is a crucial building block for modeling the Universe, so these new findings are essential in reshaping what we thought we knew."
