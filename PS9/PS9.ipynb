The authors of the original paper do note that the exact magnification has not been determined, which is necessary to concretely condlude that these \"sparkles\" are in fact evolved globular clusters. If this is the case, these findings would be the first discovered globular clusters that stopped forming stars extremely so early in the history of the Universe. These findings could be the beginning of more research to come that would shed light on the mysterious mechanisms from the era of reionization."

    "## 2 The Cosmic Microwave Background [50 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "The big bang theory predicts that background light was freely emitted as black-body radiation when the universe cooled to around 3,000 K 380,000 years after its beginning. Why did the universe have to wait this long? In the beginning the big bang predicts that the universe would be filled with a very hot and dense soup of subatomic particle plasma, which was opaque to light (optically thick). As the universe expanded it cooled, and eventually reached a tipping point after a few hundred thousand years where it was cool enough that the first atoms (mostly H) could form &mdash; these atoms were basically transparent when compared with the earlier subatomic plasma soup, so all of the light that was bouncing around in the early universe was let out in an instant, to freely travel across cosmic time and space. Because space has expanded a great deal since the big bang this radiation has been redshifted into the microwave portion of the EM spectrum, hence we call it the cosmic *microwave* background (CMB). Because it was emitted at the moment the universe became mostly transparent, this radiation marks the farthest back in time and space we can possibly see. The big bang theory predicted the properties of the cosmic microwave background before it was observed, thus its observation is one of the fundamental underpinnings of this theory and why we think it is the best explanation for how our universe was formed. \n",

Considering this, the CMB having a redshift of over 1000 solidifies the fact that this is by far the farthest observable point in the Universe's history. The Big Bang Theory predicts that the Universe's particles will go from ionized to neutral, releasing a huge uniform burst of radiation in the process; this is what we observe in the CMB. The redshift found correlates to the time of this event, between the eras of Nuclei and Atoms. And since this event signifies the turn from the Universe being opaque to transparent, it makes sense that the CMB matches up with the Big Bang predictions."
