# ASTR 1040 Fa23 Jupyter notebooks

This repository will host Jupyter notebooks / other code as needed throughout the semester. You can download all of the files with the big green button (easiest) or you can set up a git repository on your own computer that will keep track of this one (harder, but a worthwhile exercise). Talk to Kirk if you need help!

An introduction to Jupyter notebooks/Python is included in [`L1.ipynb`](L1.ipynb), and a sample blank homework notebook (with all of the useful constants you will need for the semester + a few useful `astropy` commands) is located at [`homeworkTemplate.ipynb`](homeworkTemplate.ipynb).
