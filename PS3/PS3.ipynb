    "The first cell (below) contains lots of helpful constants you may need to use throughout the semester. Make sure to run it each time before you start working! \n",
    "\n",
    "For reference, all of the `astropy` constants as well as examples can be found [here](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/constants/index.html). Likewise all of the units and their names / how to access them can be found [here](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/index.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a variable with units you need to multiply by the corresponding unit class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d = 1 * units.au\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then convert unitful quantities to other units by calling the `to` method and passing the desired end unit class: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d_m = d.to(units.m)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a ratio of quanities where all the units should cancel out, you can obtain the dimensionles number using the `dimesionless_unscaled` method. For example writing:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d_m/d\n",
    "``` \n",
    "yields $1.4959787\\times 10^{11} \\rm{\\frac{m}{AU}}$, but doing:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "(d_m/d).to(units.dimensionless_unscaled)\n",
    "```\n",
    "returns `1.0` as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you may get answers in weird units, but many of them can cancel out. A handy trick for seeing which units cancel is to write `.si` after the quantity, i.e. `d.si` and it will conver whatever units you have to SI units.\n",

    "\n",
    "This problem presents one of several early mathematical tests of the nebular theory. A star needs to get its core temperature to roughly 15 million K to sustain fusion reactions. For stars to be formed from large clouds of cool gas something must heat them up as they contract &mdash; your job in this problem will be to test if there is enough gravitational energy available to cause a newly formed star to heat up sufficiently to start nuclear fusion. The goal is not to be exact but just to check if it is plausible that stars form from interstellar clouds, thus all answers only need $\\sim$ 1-2 significant figures (the order of magnitude is really what we're after here). \n",

If the hydrogen free-falls from greater than 1 ly away, how much gravitational energy is converted to kinetic energy by the time this 1 kg of H reaches just above the Sun's surface? Assume that the Sun is nearly completely formed (so that its mass and radius are the same as they are today). Calculate and report your answer in the code cell below."
