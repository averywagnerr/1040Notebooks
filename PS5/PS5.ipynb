    "    - When the Sun becomes a red giant, it's radius will expand while its temperature will decrease. Currently, the solar flux we get on Earth is 1366 $\\frac{W}{m^2}$. If we want to preserve habitable conditions, we need to maintain the amount of energy we are getting from the Sun at any given moment. We can make the assumption by looking at an HR diagram that a red giant Earth would have a luminosity of ~$10^4L_\\odot$. From here we can set up the equation $$1366 \\frac{W}{m^2} =\\frac{10^4L_\\odot}{4\\pi d^2}$$ In solving for $d$, we get $$d =\\sqrt{\\frac{10^4L_\\odot}{5464\\pi}}$$ This comes out to $d = 99.82292$ AU!\n",

Imagine you exist during this time and work with a team of scientists and engineers to build a huge, state-of-the-art spacecraft with a mass of $10^7$ kg. Humans can't stay on Earth while its orbit is being shifted, so the goal of the spacecraft is to safely harbor humanity while other super high tech inventions are moving Earth's orbit around. \n",

    "    - We found earlier that the orbital transfer time for Earth is ~357.933 years. Since the spacecraft will be travelling at such high speeds, we need to apply relativity to our calculations. We can look at the time dilation we would experience while travelling on the spacecraft over this timeframe using the equation $$t' = \\frac{t}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$ Where $t'$ is the time measured from an observer outside the frame of reference, $t$ is the time measured inside the frame of reference, and $v$ is the speed of the spacecraft. We can rewrite this with our known values to solve for $t$: $$357.933 = \\frac{t}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{(0.98c)^2}{c^2}}}$$ $$t = 357.933\\sqrt{1-\\frac{(0.98c)^2}{c^2}}$$ See the code block for calculations:"
