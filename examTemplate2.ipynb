    "This is a template file you can use to complete your exam. The first cell (below after FAQ section) contains lots of helpful constants you may need. Make sure to run it before you start working! \n",

    "This is a template file you can use to do your homeworks in. I recommend copying this each time you start a homework. The first cell (below) contains lots of helpful constants you may need to use throughout the semester. Make sure to run it each time before you start working! \n",
    "\n",
    "For reference, all of the `astropy` constants as well as examples can be found [here](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/constants/index.html). Likewise all of the units and their names / how to access them can be found [here](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/index.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a variable with units you need to multiply by the corresponding unit class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d = 1 * units.au\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then convert unitful quantities to other units by calling the `to` method and passing the desired end unit class: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d_m = d.to(units.m)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a ratio of quanities where all the units should cancel out, you can obtain the dimensionles number using the `dimesionless_unscaled` method. For example writing:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d_m/d\n",
    "``` \n",
    "yields $1.4959787\\times 10^{11} \\rm{\\frac{m}{AU}}$, but doing:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "(d_m/d).to(units.dimensionless_unscaled)\n",
    "```\n",
    "returns `1.0` as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may also be useful to convert quantities to SI units, and you can do this on any quantity that has units by adding `.si` to it. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d.si\n",
    "```\n",
    "returns $1.4959787\\times 10^{11} \\textrm{ m}$ as this is an AU in SI units (SI unit of distance is the m).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever need to obtain just the *number* of a quantity (without any units) you can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d.value\n",
    "```\n",
    "which returns $1$ (no units, just the number 1 since we said `d = 1 * units.au`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Math FAQ <a id='mathhelp'></a>\n",
    "Let's say we have two numbers assigned to variables `x` and `y`, i.e.:\n",

    "y = 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addition/subtraction/multiplication/division work largely how you would expect:\n",

    "To add:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x_plus_y = x+y\n",
    "print(x_plus_y)\n",
    ">>> 3.\n",
    "```\n",
    "To subtract:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x_minus_y = x-y\n",
    "print(x_minus_y)\n",
    ">>> -1.\n",
    "```\n",
    "To multiply:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x_times_y = x*y\n",
    "print(x_times_y)\n",
    ">>> 2.\n",
    "```\n",
    "To divide:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x_over_y = x/y\n",
    "print(x_over_y)\n",
    ">>> 0.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "Unfortunately exponents are probably *not* what you would expect, but to raise to a power you do:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "y_tothe_x = y**x #note the ** for exponents\n",
    "```\n",
    "Oftentimes in astrophysics we have very large numbers, i.e. the mass of the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy (Sag A*) is $\\sim 4\\times 10^6 \\rm{M_\\odot}$. To write this number in python we can use the convenient \"e\" syntax:\n",

Because the slope of the graph for 1929 is ~50 km/s/Mpc, and our current estimate for $H_0$ is 70 km/s/Mpc, this implies that they would think the universe is older than we think it is today."

Assuming Sterling's mind is set, I would encourage him to jump into a supermassive black hole as opposed to a stellar mass, because a supermassive black hole would technically be less violent in the spaghettification process. This is because a black hole's density is inversely proportional to the square of its mass, meaning that the larger the black hole, the less dense it will be and thus this would make its effects less harsh on Sterling's body.\n",
