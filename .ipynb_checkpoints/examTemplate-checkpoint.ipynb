    "This is a template file you can use to do your homeworks in. I recommend copying this each time you start a homework. The first cell (below) contains lots of helpful constants you may need to use throughout the semester. Make sure to run it each time before you start working! \n",
    "\n",
    "For reference, all of the `astropy` constants as well as examples can be found [here](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/constants/index.html). Likewise all of the units and their names / how to access them can be found [here](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/index.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a variable with units you need to multiply by the corresponding unit class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d = 1 * units.au\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then convert unitful quantities to other units by calling the `to` method and passing the desired end unit class: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d_m = d.to(units.m)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a ratio of quanities where all the units should cancel out, you can obtain the dimensionles number using the `dimesionless_unscaled` method. For example writing:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d_m/d\n",
    "``` \n",
    "yields $1.4959787\\times 10^{11} \\rm{\\frac{m}{AU}}$, but doing:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "(d_m/d).to(units.dimensionless_unscaled)\n",
    "```\n",
    "returns `1.0` as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may also be useful to convert quantities to SI units, and you can do this on any quantity that has units by adding `.si` to it. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d.si\n",
    "```\n",
    "returns $1.4959787\\times 10^{11} \\textrm{ m}$ as this is an AU in SI units (SI unit of distance is the m).\n",

    "If you ever need to obtain just the *number* of a quantity (without any units) you can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d.value\n",

    "which returns $1$ (no units, just the number 1 since we said `d = 1 * units.au`).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. What are the key properties of the sun? Put them in a context that makes them\n",
    "meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Mass, size, surface temperature, and composition are all important properties of stars. Our Sun is pretty 'average' in all of these. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. How does $E=mc^2$ power stars?\n",
    "    \n",
    "> $E=mc^2$ is the equation for Energy that we use with regard to *nuclear fusion*. The tiny difference in mass in the reaction ($4 ^1H + 2e$ and $4 ^4He$) results in energy being created.\n",
    "> Stars then use fusion reactions to power their cores and continue the process of nuclear burning inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Why does nuclear fusion require high temperatures and pressures?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Nuclear fusion requires very high temperatures and pressures because **higher temps = higher speeds**. Higher speeds overcome the electromagnetic repulsion experienced by nuclei when they come close to each other, and they thus are able to bind together.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In addition, nuclear fusion relies on **quantum tunneling**. Ignoring quantum tunneling, if we try to calculate the required thermal energy to begin fusion, we will get a number significantly higher than that of our own Sun. But our Sun is fusing, so what else is happening in there? Quantum tunneling builds on the uncertainty principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is quantum tunneling and why is it important in the sun?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Quantum tunneling is important for fusion because it is how nuclei overcome the electromagnetic repulsive barrier between each other. They instead just 'sneak' through the barrier via tunneling.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What kind of equilibrium governs the Sun? Why is this important?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hydrostatic equilibrium: core is at high temperature & high density preventing gravitational collapse.\n",
    "> Energy balance: between fusion and surface radiation.\n",
    "> Solar thermostat: tight negative feedback loop for fusion which prevents a runaway reaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Where in the Sun is the energy generated, and by what process? How does energy\n",
    "get transported out of the Sun?\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the core by fusion. Energy is transported out of the Sun by radiative diffusion.\n",
    "> amount of energy produced by fusion = surface radiation\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the photosphere of the Sun? What is its temperature? How is the temperature\n",
    "measured?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The photosphere of the Sun is the surface of the Sun and thus its T is the Sun's surface temperature.\n",
    "> Temperature is measured by using the peak wavelength measured and Wien's law.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is helioseismology, and what can be learned from it?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Helioseismology is the study that measures Doppler maps of the Sun and Stars to determine its direction of rotation.\n",
    "    > Blue shift = coming towards us in rotation, Red = away\n",

    "\n",

    "    1. The \"solar thermostat\" is a concept meant to describe how the Sun is able to sustain self-regulation through a tight, negative feedback loop for fusion that prevents a runaway reaction from occuring. Additionally, the Sun maintains Hydrostatic Equilibrium, which prevents its gravitational collapse, as well as an Energy Balance between fusion and surface radiation. The Sun is getting gradually brighter because within its core, each nuclear fusion reaction releases Energy, causing the core to shrink and its temperature to tise, which increases the rate of fusion and thus causes an increase in brightness over time.\n",

    "    2. *There are more stars with masses less than / close to the mass of our Sun because there fundamentally must be more low-mass stars in the Universe than high-mass stars. This is because it takes less energy to form more massive stars, and because the cloud from which a star forms must have more mass.*\n",

    "        a. The axes of the color-magnitude are transferrable because the x-axis for Color measures blue-red magnitudes, which tell us information about the temperature of a star. In general, blue stars are hotter than red stars, so we can use this data to infer about a star's temperature, which is plotted on the HR diagram. The y-axis looks at absolute magnitude, which is essentially the brightness of a star as seen from some standard point in the sky. Thus, we can use this data to estimate a star's luminosity, as seen on the HR diagram.\n",

    "        *b.* One difference between the diagrams is that the Gaia diagram does not display white dwarfs well. This may be because they are simply harder to observe as they are dimmer. Another difference is that there is a slight difference in the actual shape of the data, which may be from the fact that the Gaia diagram is only a sample of data, which may cause the skewing from the HR model.\n"
